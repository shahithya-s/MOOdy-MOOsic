# MOOdy-MOOsic!
“MOO-dy MOO-sic” is a song generator in which the user selects their current mood and a playlist corresponding to that mood will be displayed for the user. Eight songs from a corresponding genre will be displayed on the screen, and the user will be able to see the song title, artist and album cover. The website was built with HTML, CSS (using the Bootstrap 4 Framework) and JavaScript. JavaScript also handled fetching and implementing data using the Spotify Web API.
